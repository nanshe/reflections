What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the .git file which will track changes to files when they are 
committed. 


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

It's an temporary place to put files to be committed. It allows you to add some but not necessarily all files in the directory to the repository.
