When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to commit a change and have it backed up on the server and/or you want the commit 
accessible to other developers


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may not want the changes from the remote if it contains changes from another developer.
